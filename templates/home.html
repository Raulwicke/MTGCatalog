<h1>Welcome to My MTG Collection Portal!</h1>

    <p>
        Explore the curated digital catalog of my personal 
        <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en" target="_blank">Magic: The Gathering</a> collection, 
        meticulously documented and shared in the hopes of completing the missing pieces across various iconic sets. 
        Whether you're here to admire the collection, compare notes, or collaborate in filling the gaps, 
        this platform offers a comprehensive view of the cards that make up my journey through the MTG multiverse.

        This is more than a databaseâ€”it's a living archive of my passion for Magic, 
        designed to connect with fellow collectors and enthusiasts.
